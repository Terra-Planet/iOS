Open source non-custodial Terra Wallet. We send your finance from the Earth to the Moon

To run this project first clone the [Backend](https://github.com/Terra-Planet/backend) project and put the content into the `nodejs-project` folder and run `npm install`. Also, you have to install the Pods, so be sure to have CocoaPods and run `pod install`.
I promise to add the backend as a git sub-module in the future.
